  ```
- Run all unit tests.
  ```
  pytest
  ```
- Measure code coverage.
  ```
  coverage run -m pytest
  ```
- Visualize code coverage.

  - View code coverage summary in terminal.
    ```
    coverage report
    ```
  - Generate HTML code coverage report.
    ```
    coverage html
    ```
  - View code coverage directly inside your code.
    ```
    coverage xml
    ```
    
    _Install the Coverage Gutters extension if you are using Visual Studio Code, and click on "Watch" on the left side of the status bar in the bottom of the IDE to visualize the code coverage._
